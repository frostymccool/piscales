to use the piscales service...
use restart if unsure if service already running or not.
suggest put these couple entries into crontab, so as not to leave the bluetooth polling service active all day, 
so band the time period around where you likely want to measure.
i.e in my case 5-12 will cover extremes and force the readings to only be allowed in the morning for consistancy

/home/pi/smart-scale/piscales.sh restart
/home/pi/smart-scale/piscales.sh stop

Using keepalive as somewhere, maybe memory leak, after a time the process hangs
@reboot /home/pi/smart-scale/piscales_keepalive.sh
4 5 * * * /home/pi/smart-scale/piscales.sh restart
*/11 5-12 * * * /home/pi/smart-scale/piscales_keepalive.sh
4 13 * * * /home/pi/smart-scale/piscales.sh stop

Another option is to push this through periodically to make sure the service is always running and restart if any crashes etc.
This example runs every ht
# * */1 * * * /home/pi/smart-scale/piscales_keepalive.sh
